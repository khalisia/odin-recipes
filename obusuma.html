    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Ugali or posho or sima (for others, see ยง Names) is a type of maize swallow made from maize or corn flour in several countries in Africa.[1] Sima is sometimes made from other flours, such as millet or sorghum flour, and is sometimes mixed with cassava flour.[citation needed] It is cooked in boiling water or milk until it reaches a stiff or firm dough-like consistency.[2] In 2017, the dish was added to the UNESCO Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity, one of a few foods in the list.</p>
